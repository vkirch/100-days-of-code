### Day 3: August 26, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Just a little under half way through the applied visual design portion of freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. My focus today was not the greatest, I'm going to have to try out coding in the morning instead of at night.

### Day 12: September 5, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Just finishing up the survey form. Trying to style it better so we'll see if I can finish it tomorrow.

### Day 13: September 6, 2018 


**Today's Progress**:  Finished the survey and now moving on towards the landing page project. I got to only style the survey a  little more but I'm still looking to come back to it at a later point. We'll see.

### Day 14: September 7, 2018 


**Today's Progress**:  Okay got the skeleton of my landing page to work and almost all the requirements for the project. I'm having trouble really understanding how to layout my website from the CSS side of things. 

**Thoughts:** Still doing good, verging on the side of frustration. 

### Day 15: September 8, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Slowly being able to re-style my landing page. Very tedious but so far I'm happy with the progress I'm seeing.

### Day 16: September 9, 2018 


**Today's Progress**:   The good news is that the landing page looks decent but of course it's still not what I want it to be.... yet. I'll keep trying tomorrow :)

**Thoughts:** I think I'll dedicate another day or two but after that I have to move on to the next project. 

### Day 17: September 11, 2018 


**Today's Progress**:   Finished the landing page! 

**Thoughts:** Not quite what I was hoping it would look like but I needed to move on. Regardless, I'm happy with the end result. 

### Day 18: September 12, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Now working on the technical document project. Got a good chunk done.

**Thoughts:** Happy so far with the rate at which I'm getting this project done. Struggling with the layout again. It looks like I need to debug my code cause in theory everything should be working...


### Day 19: September 13, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Had some trouble setting up a two unequal column layout as it was causing a horizontal overflow... I was also very tired thus making small mistakes but I'm almost done and I'm happy with it.

**Thoughts:** Doing good.
