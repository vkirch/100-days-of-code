# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 23, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Working through FreeCodeCamp's Basic CSS curriculum. 

**Thoughts:** Nothing too exciting yet, will keep you posted. 

### Day 2: August 25, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Made it to the applied visual design portion of the Responsive Web Development certification. 

**Thoughts:** Got stuck on type selectors but once I got through it I was able to work through the rest at a good pace.

### Day 3: August 26, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Just a little under half way through the applied visual design portion of freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. My focus today was not the greatest, I'm going to have to try out coding in the morning instead of at night.

### Day 4: August 27, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Almost done the applied visualization section of FreeCodeCamp Basic Web Development certification. Wasn't able to get up early enough to code in the morning, maybe tomorrow.

**Thoughts:**  Going to have to figure out how to code in the mornings rather than at night. This isn't working for me.
